Houseform is a platform to invest in real estate projects through fractional ownership. Investors can buy shares of buildings and builders can get funds to build and manage physical assets.

Users can look at the projects listed on Houseform with the corresponding data like the amount of shares available, the goal amount and the expected profit. When they decide to buy shares of a project, they get an amount of KIP37 NFTs equal to the number of shares they bought. These shares represent the ownership of a fraction of the building and can be kept or traded in the open market. When the project is completed and the building has been sold, project shares can be redeemed by burning the corresponding NFT and obtaining an amount based on how much profitable was building selling.

In the same way, builders can list projects, get funded to build/manage them and obtain a builder fee for the work done.
